# React 3
Assets
Next.js can serve static assets, like images, under the top-level public directory. Files inside public can be referenced from the root of the application similar to pages.

The public directory is also useful for robots.txt, Google Site Verification, 
and any other static assets. Check out the documentation for Static File Serving to learn more.

## Download Your Profile Picture:
* Download your profile picture in .jpg format (or use this file).
* Create an images directory inside of the public directory.
* Save the picture as profile.jpg in the public/images directory.
* The image size can be around 400px by 400px.
* You may remove the unused SVG logo file directly under the public directory.

## Use the Image Component
Instead of optimizing images at build time, Next.js optimizes images on-demand, as users request them. Unlike static site generators and static-only solutions, your build times are not increase, whether shipping 10 images or 10 million images.
Here is an example using next/image to display our profile picture.

```
import Image from 'next/image'

const YourComponent = () => (
  <Image
    src="/images/profile.jpg" // Route of the image file
    height={144} // Desired size with correct aspect ratio
    width={144} // Desired size with correct aspect ratio
    alt="Your Name"
  />
)

```
## Metadata
What if we wanted to modify the metadata of the page, such as the < title> HTML tag??

< title > is part of the < head> HTML tag, so let's dive into how we can modify the < head> tag in a Next.js page.

Open pages/index.js in your editor and find the following lines:
```
<Head>
  <title>Create Next App</title>
  <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
</Head>

```
Notice that < Head > is used instead of the lowercase < head>. < Head> is a React Component that is built into Next.js. It allows you to modify the < head> of a page.


Adding Head to first-post.js We haven't added a <title> to our /posts/first-post route. Let's add one.

Open the pages/posts/first-post.js file and add an import for Head from next/head at the beginning of the file:

```
import Head from 'next/head'
Then, update the exported FirstPost component to include the Head component. 
For now, we‘ll add just the title tag:
export default function FirstPost() {
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <title>First Post</title>
      </Head>
      <h1>First Post</h1>
      <h2>
        <Link href="/">
          <a>Back to home</a>
        </Link>
      </h2>
    </>
  )
}
```

## CSS Styling

```
    <style jsx>{`
    …
    `}</style>
```
>Write and Importing CSS:
Next.js has built-in support for CSS and Sass which allows you to import .css and .scss files. Using popular CSS libraries like Tailwind CSS is also supported.
