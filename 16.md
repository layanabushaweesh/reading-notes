## Machine Learning Intro

Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience and by the use of data.

It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence.

Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, 
known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.

Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine, email filtering, and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.

## Machine Learning Tasks
* A task is a specific objective for your algorithms.
* Algorithms can be swapped in and out, as long as you pick the right task.
* you should always try multiple algorithms because you most likely won't know which one will perform best for your dataset.

### Supervised Learning
Supervised learning includes tasks for "labeled" data (i.e. you have a target variable).

* it's often used as an advanced form of predictive modeling.
* Each observation must be labeled with a "correct answer."
* Only then can you build a predictive model because you must tell the algorithm what's "correct" while training it (hence, "supervising" it).
* Regression is the task for modeling continuous target variables.
Classification is the task for modeling categorical (a.k.a. "class") target variables.


### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning includes tasks for "unlabeled" data (i.e. you do not have a target variable).

* In practice, it's often used either as a form of automated data analysis or automated signal extraction.
* Unlabeled data has no predetermined "correct answer."
* You'll allow the algorithm to directly learn patterns from the data (without "supervision").
Clustering is the most common unsupervised learning task, and it's for finding groups within your data.
