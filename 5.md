## Linked List :
A data structure that contains nodes that points to the next node in the list.

Linked List Types: Singly & Doubly

Nodes are the individual items inside a link list, There are also , current , head , next nodes which they explain their selves by their name , node where you are at , first node in the list, and teh next node from the current accordingly ,we use next and current to loop over the list.
Adding Nodes If you want to add a node to a list before the Head node you can add it by following a procedure , create a function that calls a property newNode.next which will be equals to null since it doesn't exist yet , set it to node1 , change head value to be as newNode , Done. !

exception : if you want to add it between two number , same procedure but you have to change the next value for the node before the newNode is added.

## traverse through a linked list :
Current: is node that will tell us where exactly in the linked list we are and will allow us to move/traverse forward until we hit the end.

When constructing your code, a few things to keep in mind :

When making your Node class, consider requiring a value to be passed in to require that each node has a value.

When making a Linked List, you may want to require that at least one node gets passed in upon instantiation. This first node is what your Head and Current will point too.

## linear data structures:
which means that there is a sequence and an order to how they are constructed and traversed.

## non-linear data structures:
items dont have to be arranged in order, which means that we could traverse the data structure non-sequentially.
