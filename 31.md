 ## Docker

 > Docker : which is a way to isolate and run entire applications. With Docker it doesn’t matter if you are using a Mac, Windows, or Linux computer anymore. The entire development environment is isolated: programming language, software packages, databases, and more. With Docker we now longer have to mess around with virtual environments. We can faithfully reproduce a production environment locally. And Docker can be shared among team members so everyone is working on the same setup. Wins all around. Docker is really just Linux containers which are a type of virtualization. Virtualization has its roots at the beginning of computer science when large, expensive mainframe computers were the norm. How could multiple programmers use the same single machine? The answer was virtualization and specifically virtual machines which are complete copies of a computer system from the operating system on up. in recent years Linux containers, also known as “containerization,” has become increasingly popular. For most applications, a virtual machine provides far more resources than are needed and a container is more than sufficient. This, fundamentally, is what Docker is. A way to implement Linux containers!


## Docker objects
* Images
An image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container. Often, an image is based on another image, with some additional customization.

* Containers
A container is a runnable instance of an image.


* Install Docker
install from https://www.docker.com/get-started
run command sudo pip install docker-compose

* Image Builds
run command docker image build

### Conclusion
* Docker is a way to run Linux containers

* Containers are a lightweight alternative to Virtual Machines

* Dockerfile is a list of instructions for creating an image

* Images are made up of one or more layers

* Containers are a running instance of an image

* docker-compose.yml controls how to run the container

* Containers are stateless and ephemeral in nature. We can link - the local filesystem via volumes but things become more complex with databases (which we didn’t cover here).


## Library Website and API

Django REST framework is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.

Some reasons you might want to use REST framework:

* The Web browsable API is a huge usability win for your developers.
* Authentication policies including packages for OAuth1a and OAuth2.
* Serialization that supports both ORM and non-ORM data sources.
* Customizable all the way down - just use regular function-based views if you don't need the more powerful features.
* Extensive documentation, and great community support.
* Used and trusted by internationally recognised companies - including Mozilla, Red Hat, Heroku, and Eventbrite.


### how Django REST Framework works

* Django REST Framework works alongside the Django web framework to create web APIs. We cannot build a web API with only Django - Rest Framework; it always must be added to a project after Django itself has been installed and configured.

* The most important takeaway is that Django creates websites containing webpages, while Django REST Framework creates web APIs which are a collection of URL endpoints containing available HTTP verbs that return JSON.

* To illustrate these concepts, we will build out a basic Library website with traditional Django and then extend it into a web API with Django REST Framework.
