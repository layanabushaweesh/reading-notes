# What Is Node.js?
Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

Node Is Built on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine
The V8 engine is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. When we say that Node is built on the V8 engine, we don’t mean that Node programs are executed in a browser. Rather, the creator of Node took the V8 engine and enhanced it with various features, such as a file system API, an HTTP library, and a number of operating system–related utility methods.

Node.js Has Excellent Support for Modern JavaScript



#  What Are the Advantages of Node.js?
Aside from speed and scalability, an often-touted advantage of using JavaScript on a web server is that your brain no longer needs to switch modes. You can do everything in the same language, which, as a developer, makes you more productive.

Another of Node’s big pluses is that it speaks JSON. It is probably the most important data exchange format on the Web, and the lingua franca for interacting with object databases

JavaScript is ubiquitous: most of us are familiar with JavaScript, or have used it at some point.

# What Kind of Apps Is Node.js Suited To?
Suited to building applications that require some form of real-time interaction or collaboration, for example:

chat sites

apps such as CodeShare you can watch a document being edited live by someone else

JavaScript is everywhere, and Node is a vast and expansive subject.
