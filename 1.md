## Pain and Suffering
>In simple words, Remember why are you here firstly , then everything will be worth it , I'll come back here to read my comment whenever I need it. I'm taking this seriously to leave such a decent imprint with what I'm learning , everything will be hard at its first, that's pretty normal and okay, consistency and discipline are the ones that makes difference!

## Big O notation
>Big O notation : describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used (e.g. in memory or on disk) by an algorithm.
O(1) : describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.
O(N) : describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set
O(N2) : represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set. This is common with algorithms that involve nested iterations over the data set. Deeper nested iterations will result in O(N3), O(N4) etc.
O(2N) : denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each additon to the input data set. The growth curve of an O(2N) function is exponential - starting off very shallow, then rising meteorically
O(log N) : The iterative halving of data sets produces a growth curve that peaks at the beginning and slowly flattens out as the size of the data sets increase.

## names and values in Python
* Python is neither "Call By value" nor "Call By Reference", it's "Call by Assignment"! Epic!

* There is no way in python where a name can refer to another name.

* names refers to values in python

* many names can refer to one value

* if we have a list ,so if we modify it then all names that referring to that list will change

 * so the mechanisms almost the same between python and other languages ,but the effects can be surprising in python
