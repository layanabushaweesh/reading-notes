## Configuring Django Settings: Best Practices

### Managing Django Settings: Issues
* Sensitive data. You have SECRET_KEY in each Django project. This data cannot be stored in VCS.

* Sharing settings between team members. You need a general approach to eliminate human error when working with the settings.

* Django settings are a Python code. This is a curse and a blessing at the same time.

### Separate settings file for each environment

>Separate settings file for each environment. It allows you to keep all configurations in VCS and to share default settings between developers

>12 Factors is a collection of recommendations on how to build distributed web-apps that will be easy to deploy and scale in the Cloud.

* Codebase
* Dependencies
* Config
* Backing services
* Build, release, run
* Processes
* Port binding
* Concurrency
* Disposability
* Dev/prod parity
* Logs
* Admin processes

### Django Settings: Best practices
* Keep settings in environment variables.

* Write default values for production configuration (excluding secret keys and tokens).

* Don’t hardcode sensitive settings, and don’t put them in VCS.

* Split settings into groups: Django, third-party, project.

* Follow naming conventions for custom (project) settings.

### SSH

* SSH, or Secure Shell, is a remote administration protocol that allows users to control and modify their remote servers over the Internet.

 >The service was created as a secure replacement for the unencrypted Telnet and uses cryptographic techniques to ensure that all communication to and from the remote server happens in an encrypted manner. It provides a mechanism for authenticating a remote user, transferring inputs from the client to the host, and relaying the output back to the client.

* Gaining an in-depth understanding of the underlying how SSH works can help users understand the security aspects of this technology. Most people consider this process to be extremely complex and un-understandable, but it is much simpler than most people think. If you’re wondering how long it takes for a computer to calculate a hash and authenticate a user, well, it happens in less than a second. In fact, the maximum amount of time is spent in transferring data across the Internet.
