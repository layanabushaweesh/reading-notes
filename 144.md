## Matplotlib

Matplotlib is probably the single most used Python package for 2D-graphics. It provides both a very quick way to visualize data from Python and publication-quality figures in many formats

## IPython and the pylab mode
IPython is an enhanced interactive Python shell that has lots of interesting features including named inputs and outputs, access to shell commands, improved debugging and much more.

## pyplot
Pyplot provides a convenient interface to the matplotlib object-oriented plotting library. It is modeled closely after Matlab(TM).


## What is Seaborn?
Seaborn is a library for making statistical graphics in Python. It is built on top of matplotlib and closely integrated with pandas data structures.

## some of the functionality that seaborn offers:
A dataset-oriented API for examining relationships between multiple variables

Specialized support for using categorical variables to show observations or aggregate statistics

Options for visualizing univariate or bivariate distributions and for comparing them between subsets of data

Automatic estimation and plotting of linear regression models for different kinds dependent variables

Convenient views onto the overall structure of complex datasets

High-level abstractions for structuring multi-plot grids that let you easily build complex visualizations

Concise control over matplotlib figure styling with several built-in themes

Tools for choosing color palettes that faithfully reveal patterns in your data
