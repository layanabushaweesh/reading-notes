## Django Custom User

sometimes we don't want to use only the feilds available in the built in user model or we want to change some feilds , for example we may want to make the user log in by using email instead of the username.

in today's  will talk with you in the steps of how to create a custom user model.

## Setup
To start, create a new Django project from the command line. We need to do several things:
create and navigate into a dedicated directory called accounts for our code
install Django
make a new Django project called config
make a new app accounts
start the local web server

## commands to run:
$ cd ~/Desktop
$ mkdir accounts && cd accounts
$ pipenv install django~=3.1.0
$ pipenv shell
(accounts) $ django-admin.py startproject config .
(accounts) $ python manage.py startapp accounts
(accounts) $ python manage.py runserver


## Custom User Model

* Creating our initial custom user model requires four steps:

* update config/settings.py

* create a new CustomUser model

* create new UserCreation and UserChangeForm

* update the admin

* In settings.py we'll add the accounts app and use the AUTH_USER_MODEL config to tell Django to use our new custom user model in place of the built-in User model. We'll call our custom user model CustomUser.

* Within INSTALLED_APPS add accounts at the bottom. Then at the bottom of the entire file, add the AUTH_USER_MODEL config.

## AbstractUser vs AbstractBaseUser

There are two modern ways to create a custom user model in Django: AbstractUser and AbstractBaseUser. In both cases we can subclass them to extend existing functionality however AbstractBaseUser requires much, much more work.
