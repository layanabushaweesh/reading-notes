## Dunder Methods
Definition: In Python, special methods are a set of predefined methods you can use to enrich your classes. They are easy to recognize because they start and end with double underscores, for example init or str

Dunder methods let you emulate the behavior of built-in types. For example, to get the length of a string you can call len('string'). But an empty class definition doesn’t support this behavior out of the box:
```
  class NoLenSupport: pass
  obj = NoLenSupport() len(obj)
  TypeError: "object of type 'NoLenSupport' has no len()"
To fix this, you can add a len dunder method to your class: class LenSupport: def len(self): return 42 obj = LenSupport() len(obj) 42

```
## what is probability?
Probability is the branch of mathematics concerning numerical descriptions of how likely an event is to occur, or how likely it is that a proposition is true.

The probability of an event is a number between 0 and 1, where, roughly speaking, 0 indicates impossibility of the event and 1 indicates certainty.


## Z-score:
The Z-score is a simple calculation that answers the question, “Given a data point, how many standard deviations is it away from the mean?”

the Z-score doesn’t provide much information to you. It gains the most value when compared against a Z-table, which tabulates the cumulative probability of a standard normal distribution up until a given Z-score.

Conclusion We started with descriptive statistics and then connected them to probability. From probability, we developed a way to quantatively show if two groups come from the same distribution. In this case, we compared two wine recommendations and found that they most likely do not come from the same score distribution.
