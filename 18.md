## Cryptography

Cryptography comes from Crypto + graphy which means a secret text

the process of making text secret is called encryption and the reverse is decryption

it is used to send share or connect between users in order to protect their privacy

there are many ways used such as the exchange table where the message is being divided then placed in a table of columns then took the columns and formed a words of the same size and could be done multiply times.

## Caesar cipher

In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques

## Encryption:

Encryption is the method by which information is converted into secret code that hides the information's true meaning. The science of encrypting and decrypting information is called cryptography.(scrambling the data according to a secret key )

## decryption:

Decryption is taking encoded or encrypted text or other data and converting it back into text you or the computer can read and understand. This term could be used to describe a method of unencrypting the data manually or unencrypting the data using the proper codes or keys.( recovering the original data from scrambled data by using the secret key.)

## cracking:

Cracking is a technique used to breach computer software or an entire computer security system, and with malicious intent. Though functionally the same as hacking, cracking is strictly used in a criminal sense. Learn how cracking works, how to recognize it, and how you can protect yourself against getting cracked.(uncovering the original data without knowing the secret, by using a variety of clever techniques.)
