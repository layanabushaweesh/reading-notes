## Unit tests:
Unit tests are some pieces of code to exercise the input, the output and the behaviour of your code. You can write them anytime you want.our code will be more reliable: after a change you can run your tests .

## Unit testing Cycle
ðŸ†˜ Write a unit test and make it fail (it needs to fail because the feature isnâ€™t there, right? If this test passes, call the Ghostbusters, really)

âœ… Write the feature and make the test pass! (you can dance after that)

ðŸ”µ Refactor the code â€” the first version doesnâ€™t need to be the beautiful one (donâ€™t be shy)


## Modular programming:
Modular programming is the process of breaking a large, unwieldy programming task into separate, smaller, more manageable subtasks or modules.

> advantages to modularizing:
Simplicity:Easier to understand and debug the code.

Maintainability: Modules are typically designed so that they enforce logical boundaries between different problem domains.

Reusability: can be used in several different parts of a program.

Scoping: Modules typically define a separate namespace.

## Recursion
>The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion.

The corresponding function is called as recursive function.

It can be quite easy to slip into writing a function which never terminates, or one that uses excess amounts of memory or processor power.

However, when written correctly recursion can be a very efficient and mathematically-elegant approach to programming.
