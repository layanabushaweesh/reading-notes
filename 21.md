## Django Models

### Model
A model is the single, definitive source of information about your data. It contains the essential fields and behaviors of the data you’re storing. 
Generally, each model maps to a single database table.

### Designing the LocalLibrary models
* When designing your models it makes sense to have separate models for every "object" (a group of related information). In this case, the obvious objects are books, book instances, and authors.

* We might need to store more information about the author than just their name, and there might be multiple authors with the same or similar names. We want to be able to sort information based on book title, author, written language, and category.

### The basics of Models:
* Each model is a Python class that subclasses django.db.models.Model.

* Each attribute of the model represents a database field.

* With all of this, Django gives you an automatically-generated database-access AP.

### Fields:
A model can have an arbitrary number of fields, of any type — each one represents a column of data that we want to store in one of our database tables. 
Each database record (row) will consist of one of each field value.

### Feilds type:

* CharField is used to define short-to-mid sized fixed-length strings.

* TextField is used for large arbitrary-length strings.

* IntegerField is a field for storing integer (whole number) values, and for validating entered values as integers in forms.

* DateField and DateTimeField are used for storing/representing dates and date/time information.

* EmailField is used to store and validate email addresses.

* FileField and ImageField are used to upload files and images respectively.

* AutoField is a special type of IntegerField that automatically increments.

* ForeignKey is used to specify a one-to-many relationship to another database model


### Django admin site:

the Django admin application can use your models to automatically build a site area that you can use to create, view, update, and delete records. This can save you a lot of time during development, making it very easy to test your models and get a feel for whether you have the right data.
