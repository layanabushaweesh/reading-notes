 # Why can't a machine understand a normal web page?
Because web pages are designed to be understood by people. A machine doesn't care about layout and styling. Machines basically just need the data. Ideally, every URL would have a human readable and a machine readable representation. When a machine GETs the resource, it will ask for the machine readable one. When a browser GETs a resource for a human, it will ask for the human readable one.


Nouns weren't universal and verbs weren't polymorphic. They basically ignored throwing out decades of real field usage and proven technique and kept starting over with something that looks a lot like other systems that have failed in the past. They used HTTP but only because it let them talk to our network and security people less.
