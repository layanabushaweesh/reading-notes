## Pandas

pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.

```
Importing:

    `import numpy as np`

    `import pandas as pd`
    
```

The Pandas library is one of the most preferred tools for data scientists to do data manipulation and analysis, next to matplotlib for data visualization and NumPy, the fundamental library for scientific computing in Python on which Pandas was built.

The fast, flexible, and expressive Pandas data structures are designed to make real-world data analysis significantly easier, but this might not be immediately the case for those who are just getting started with it. Exactly because there is so much functionality built into this package that the options are overwhelming.

Pandas handle the vast majority of typical use cases in finance, statistics, social science, and many areas of engineering

pandas is built on top of NumPy and is intended to integrate well within a scientific computing environment with many other 3rd party libraries.

### The most elementary functions of pandas

Reading data : data = pd.read_csv('my_file.csv')
Writing data : data.to_csv('my_new_file.csv', index=None)
Checking the data : data.shape OR data.describe()
Seeing the data : data.head(3) OR data.loc[8] OR data.loc[8, 'column_1'] OR data.loc[range(4,6)]


### The basic functions of pandas

#### Logical operations :

data[data['column_1']=='french']
data[(data['column_1']=='french') & (data['year_born']==1990)]
data[(data['column_1']=='french') & (data['year_born']==1990) & ~(data['city']=='London')]
data[data['column_1'].isin(['french', 'english'])]

#### Basic plotting:

data['column_numerical'].plot()
data['column_numerical'].hist()
%matplotlib inline/

#### Updating the data

data.loc[8, 'column_1'] = 'english'
data.loc[data['column_1']=='french', 'column_1'] = 'French'
