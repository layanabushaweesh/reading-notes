# React 1

## Why JSX?:
React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic:
how events can be handle and how the state changes in the time,
 and how  data is prepared to display.

Instead of artificially separate technologies by put markup and logic in separate files, 
React separates concerns with loosely coupled units called `components` that contain both things.

## How Does JSX Work?:
When the JSX expressions are compiled, they are converte into Java script object, representing React elements.
React then use these elements to build the corresponding HTML DOM-Document Object Model  and can display it in the browser.

Since JSX is closer to Java script than to HTML, React DOM uses camel case property naming convention instead of HTML attribute names.

### Rendering Elements:

use => ReactDOM.render()
```
<div id="root"></div>
const element = <h1>Hello, world</h1>;
ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));

```
### Updating the Rendered Element:
the only way to update the UI is to create a new element, and pass it to ReactDOM.render() and React only updates what is ncessary.

### Function and Class Components:
function component :
```
  function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
  }
```
class component :
```
  class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
      return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
  }
```
- props are for read only

### State:
there is many web apps need their components to change their data, for example, after user interaction (clicking a button, submit) props can not be change.

In order to allow components to manage and change their data, React provides a feature called state.
State is an object that is added as a property in the class components.

### Changing State:
state should not be modified directly. Instead of that react provides a setState() method, that can be used to modify state.

### lifecycle methods:

react provide to us special life cycle methods
for class components, which are called when components are  updated , mounted or unmounted.

* mounting is the process when a component is rendered on the web page.

* unmounting is the process when a component is removed from the page.

* the componentDidMount method is called when a component is rendered on the web page.

* another lifecycle method is componentDidUpdate(), which is called when a component is updated in the DOM.

* another lifecycle method is componentWillUnmount(), which is called when a component is remove in the DOM

### The useEffect Hook
The lifecycle method we have covered are only available for class components.

React provides a special Hook called `useEffect` to make lifecycle method are available in functional components.
It combines the componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount methods into one method.


### Handling User Input
One of the common way that users interact with  pages is through text fields as forms.

* We can handle user input in React using the onChange event of the text field.
* When the value of the text field changed, the event handler is called, updating the value of the field in the components state. This way you always have the actual value of the text field in the state.

### Handling Events
Handling events in React is very similar to handling events in the DOM.

The only difference is that event names use camel case syntax and the event handler needs to be passed in curly braces.
