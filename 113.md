## Regression analysis
Regression analysis is one of the most important fields in statistics and machine learning. There are many regression methods available. Linear regression is one of them. Regression searches for relationships among variables.


## What is Linear Regressions in Python?
Linear regression is one of the fundamental statistical and machine learning techniques. Whether you want to do statistics, machine learning, or scientific computing, there are good chances that you’ll need it.
Linear regression is probably one of the most important and widely used regression techniques. It’s among the simplest 
regression methods. One of its main advantages is the ease of interpreting results.

## When Do You Need Regression?
to answer whether and how some phenomenon influences the other or how several variables are related
is also useful when you want to forecast a response using a new set of predictors.
Regression is used in many different fields: economy, computer science, social sciences


## use Linear regression :
1. Exploring Boston Housing Data Set.
2. Scikit Learn.
3. plot a scatter plot between True housing prices and True RM.

## Conclusion
explore the boston data set and then renamed its column names.
use Scikit learn to fit linear regression to the entire data set and calculate the mean squared error.
make a train-test split and calculate the mean squared error for training data and test data.
then plot the residuals for training and test datasets.
