# FileIO & Exceptions:
## What is a file ?
a file is a contiguous set of bytes used to store data. This data is organized in a specific format and can be anything as simple as a text file or as complicated as a program executable.

* Parts of the file :
Header: metadata about the contents of the file (file name, size, type, and so on)
Data: contents of the file as written by the creator or editor
End of file (EOF): special character that indicates the end of the file
What is a File Paths
Folder Path: the file folder location on the file system where subsequent folders are separated by a forward slash / (Unix) or backslash \ (Windows)

* File Paths Parts :
File Name: the actual name of the file
Extension: the end of the file path pre-pended with a period (.) - - used to indicate the file type
Opening and Closing a File in Python
Open : This is done by invoking the open() built-in function.
close : This is done by invoking the close() built-in function.

## Python Exceptions
We can tell the definition of the exception simply by its name, its not an error by itself rather an exception , there are many error such as syntax error when improperly using the syntax language , and many errors , but what special about exception is that you can raise your exceptions which can be very useful at some cases, e.g of exceptions: DivisionByZero, etc..
-we can take advantage of this feature and raise our own exceptions if conditions met, for example to make sure we achieve sth , or if I don't want my program to proceed with a specific condition , we can use if,else then raise , or try , except to process while exception occurs.
