# React 2
In React, you can create distinct component that encapsulate behavior you need.
Then, you can render only some of them, depending on the state of your application.

Conditional render in React work in the same way conditions work in Java Script. 
Use Java Script operators like if or the conditional operator to create elements represent the current state, and let React update the UI to match them.

## Element Variables
You can use variable to store elements. 
This can help you conditionally render a part of component while the rest of the output does not change.

## Preventing Component from Rendering
In rare cases you might want a component to hide itself even though it  render by another component. 
To do this return null instead of its render output.
The best way to pick a key that use a string that uniquely identifies a list item among its siblings.
most often you would use IDs from your data as keys.

## Keys
Keys help React identify which items have changed, are adde, or are remove. 
Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity
* Keys only make sense in the context of the surrounding array.

* most cases, it’s convenient to have a Java Script function that handle submission of the form and has access to the data that user entere into the form. 
The standard way to achieve this is with a technique called `controlled components`.

* we can combine the two by making the React state be the `single source of truth`. 
Then the React component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input. An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a `controlled component`.

## Forms
HTML form elements work a bit differently from other DOM elements in React, because form elements naturally keep some internal state.

## Lifting State Up
often, several components need to reflect the same change data. 
we recommend lifting the shared state up to their closest common ancestor. 

### Lessons Learned

* there should be a single `source of truth` for any data that changed in a React .
often, the state is first added to the component that need it for render.
Then, if other components also need it, you can lift it up to their closest common ancestor. 
instead of trying to sync the state between different components, you should rely on the top-down data flow.

* Lifting state involves writing more `boilerplate` code than two-way binding approaches, 
but as a benefit, it takes less work to find and isolate bugs.
>Since any state be in some component and that component alone can change it, 
the surface area for bugs is greatly reduced.
also, you can implement any custom logic to reject or transform user input.

* When you see something wrong in the UI, you can use React Developer Tools to inspect the props and move up the tree until you find the component responsible for updating the state.

### Composition vs Inheritance
React has a powerful composition model, 
and we recommend to use composition instead of inheritance to reuse the
code between components.

### What About Inheritance
* At Facebook, we use React in thousands of components, and we have not found any use cases where we would recommend creating component inheritance hierarchies.

* prop and composition give you all the flexibility you need to customize a components look and behavior in an explicit and safe way.remember that components may accept arbitrary prop, including primitive values, React elements, or functions.

* if you want to reuse non-UI functionality between component, we suggest extracting it into a separate Java Script module. The components may import it and use that function, object, or a class, without extend
it.

### Thinking in React
React is, in our opinion, the premier way to build big, fast Web apps with JavaScript. It has scaled very well for us at Facebook and Instagram.
one of the many great parts of React is how it makes you think about apps as you build them.

### Specialization
Sometimes we think about components as being “special cases” of other components. 
For example, we can say that a WelcomeDialog is a special case of Dialog.
