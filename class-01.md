# HTML
* HTML Describes the Structure of Pages
* Elements are usually two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag. (The closing tag
has an extra forward slash in it.) Each HTML element tells the browser something about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags.
* Tags are often referred to as elements.
* Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content.

>You can add comments to your code between the
<!-- and --> markers.
> The id and class attributes allow you to identify
particular elements.
> The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group
block-level and inline elements together.
> <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through
which other pages can be displayed.
> Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements.
>  It's important to understand who your target audience
is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return and Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
