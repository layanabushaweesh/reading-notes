## Permissions & Postgresql

* Django REST framework is a powerful and flexible toolkit that makes it easy to build Web APIs. It provides class based generic API views and serializers. We've taken all the attributes and methods that every view/serializer defines or inherits, and flattened all that information onto one comprehensive page per class.

* Permissions in REST framework are always defined as a list of permission classes.

* Before running the main body of the view each permission in the list is checked. If any permission check fails an exceptions.PermissionDenied or exceptions.

* When the permissions checks fail either a "403 Forbidden" or a "401 Unauthorized" response will be returned, according to the following rules:

* The request was successfully authenticated, but permission was denied. — An HTTP 403 Forbidden response will be returned.

* The request was not successfully authenticated, and the highest priority authentication class does not use WWW-Authenticate headers. — An HTTP 403 Forbidden response will be returned.

* The request was not successfully authenticated, and the highest priority authentication class does use WWW-Authenticate headers. — An HTTP 401 Unauthorized response, with an appropriate WWW-Authenticate header will be returned.

## Object level permissions

REST framework permissions also support object-level permissioning. Object level permissions are used to determine if a user should be allowed to act on a particular object, which will typically be a model instance.

## Django Model Permissions

* This permission class ties into Django's standard django.contrib.auth model permissions.

* This permission must only be applied to views that have a .queryset property or get_queryset() method.

* Authorization will only be granted if the user is authenticated and has the relevant model permissions assigned.

1. POST requests require the user to have the add permission on the model.

2. PUT and PATCH requests require the user to have the change permission on the model.

3. DELETE requests require the user to have the delete permission on the model.

## Django Object Permissions

* This permission class ties into Django's standard object permissions framework that allows per-object permissions on models. In order to use this permission class, you'll also need to add a permission backend that supports object-level permissions, such as django-guardian.

* As with DjangoModelPermissions, this permission must only be applied to views that have a .queryset property or .get_queryset() method. Authorization will only be granted if the user is authenticated and has the relevant per-object permissions and relevant model permissions assigned.

1. POST requests require the user to have the add permission on the model instance.

2. PUT and PATCH requests require the user to have the change permission on the model instance.

3. DELETE requests require the user to have the delete permission on the model instance.

## Custom permissions
To implement a custom permission, override BasePermission and implement either, or both, of the following methods:

* .has_permission(self, request, view)

* .has_object_permission(self, request, view, obj)
