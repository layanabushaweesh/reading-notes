## Classes and Objects
Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity that get them from classes but classes are most like template or a blueprint to create your objects
Example: `` class MyClass: variable = "blah"

def function(self): print("This is a message inside the class.")

myobject = MyClass()
``

you can create as many objects as you want from the class as long as you assigning the object and for the class call, you can access the variables inside the object using dot notation , and thats for functions as well with the call ():
    myobject.variable

## Thinking Recursively in Python

typical structure of a recursive algorithm:
If the current problem represents a simple case, solve it. If not, divide it into sub-problems and apply the same strategy to them A recursive function: is a function defined in terms of itself via self-referential expressions.

This means that the function will continue to call itself and repeat its behavior until some condition is met to return a result
When dealing with recursive functions, keep in mind that each recursive call has its own execution context

Pytest Fixtures and Coverage
#### Fixtures:
In pytest, you define fixtures using a combination of the pytest.fixture decorator, along with a function definition. For example, say you have a file that returns a list of lines from a file, in which each line is reversed:

#### Coverage:
its a package that will create a report with every part of the python library to the used program
