# HTML
- HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).

- <h1> h2> <h3> <h4> <h5> <h6>HTML has six "levels" of heading

- They also provide semantic information (e.g. where emphasis should be placed, the definition of any cronyms used, when given text is a quotation).

# CSS
> CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside
its own box and uses rules to indicate how that
element should look.
> Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the
elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that
indicate what these elements should look like).
>Different types of selectors allow you to target your
rules at different elements.
> Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties
of the element that you want to change, and the values
of those properties. For example, the font-family
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
> CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,
although they may appear within an HTML page.


# Javascript
## A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
> Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.
>Statements should end with a semicolon.
>You should write comments to explain what your code does.
They help make your code easier to read and understand.
This can help you and others who read your code.
I* Th i s script displays a greeting to the user based upon the current time.
It is an example from JavaScript & jQuer y book *I 
**  A VARIABLE is a script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables **

>JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9),
>strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
>Expressions evaluate into a single value.
>Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value. 

## descisions and loops 
* Conditional statements allow your code to make
decisions about what to do next.
* Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>)
are used to compare two operands.
* Logical operators allow you to combine more than one
* set of comparison operators.
* if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code
if a condition is true, and another if it is false.
* switch statements allow you to compare a value
against possible outcomes (and also provides a default
option if none match).
* Data types can be coerced from one type to another.
* All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.
There are three types of loop: for, while, and
do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements
