# HTML
## links
> Links are created using the <a> element.
> The <a> element uses the href attribute to indicate
the page you are linking to.
> If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is
best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
>email address in the "to" field.
> You can use the id attribute to target elements within
a page that can be linked to.
## layout
><div> elements are often used as containing elements
to group together sections of a page.
>Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
>The float property moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
>Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
>Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
>Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
>CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
>You can include multiple CSS files in one page.

## functions methods and objective
>Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements .
> to create  function you will give it a name then write a statment.
> when you declared the function then you can execute all the statment between its curly braces.
> when you call a function you specify the value and should use in parantheses that follow the name.
>The location where you declare a variable will affect where it can be used
within your code. If you declare it within a function, it can only be used
within that function. This is known as the variable's scope.
