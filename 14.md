# Database Normalization
Database normalization is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns.

The stages of organization are called normal forms; there are three normal forms most databases adhere to using.

# # There are three main reasons to normalize a database:

The first is to minimize duplicate data,
the second is to minimize or avoid data modification issues,
and the third is to simplify queries.
EmployeeId	SalesPerson	SalesOffice	OfficeNumber	Customer1	Customer2	Customer3
1003	Mary Smith	Chicago	312-555-1212	Ford	GM	
1004	John Hunt	New York	212-555-1212	Dell	HP	Apple
1005	Martin Hap	Chicago	312-555-1212	Boeing	HP	Apple
In the example above, the table serves many purposes, not just one... which causes data duplication. For each SalesPerson we listed the SalesOffice, and for each SalesOffice we listen the OfficeNumber... Duplicated information presents two problems:

It increases storage and decreases performance.
It becomes more difficult to maintain data changes... such as changing the number of an office, or changing the office of a SalesPerson.
There are three modification anomalies that can occur:

Insert Anomaly, for example, we cannot insert a SalesOffice unless we know a SalesPerson, because we need a primary key which, in this case, is the EmployeeId.
Update Anomaly, to change the OfficeNumber of one office requires multiple changes in all the instances.
Deletion Anomaly, deleting one row can cause more than one set of facts to be removed... if one employee retires, a whole SalesOffice might be lost from the database, such as John Hunt.
There are three common forms of normalization: 1st, 2nd, and 3rd normal form:
