# HTML
> There are three types of HTML lists: ordered,
unordered, and definition.
>Ordered lists use numbers.
>Unordered lists use bullets.
> Definition lists are used to define terminology.
> Lists can be nested inside one another.
# CSS
CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box.
* You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.
* You can also control the borders, margin and padding
for each box with CSS.
* It is possible to hide elements using the display and
visibility properties.
* Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and
inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
* Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of
boxes containing text and the leading.
* CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image
borders and rounded borders.

VALUES IN AN ARRAY
* The first lines of code on the left
create an array containing a list
of three colors. (The values can
be added on the same line or on
separate lines as shown here.)
Having created the array, the
third item on the list is changed
from 'custom' to 'beige'.
To access a value from an array,
after the array name you specify
the index number for that value
inside square brackets.
You can change the value of an
item an array by selecting it and
assigning it a new value

* An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking
there are two types of expressions.
 
* Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to
create a single value from one or more values.

> loops

* Conditional statements allow your code to make
decisions about what to do next.
* Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>)
are used to compare two operands.
 * Logical operators allow you to combine more than one
set of comparison operators.
 * if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code
if a condition is true, and another if it is false.
* switch statements allow you to compare a value
against possible outcomes (and also provides a default
option if none match).
* Data types can be coerced from one type to another.
* All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.
