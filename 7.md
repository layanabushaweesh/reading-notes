# Python Scope
Python turns your program’s main script into a module called main to hold the main program’s execution. Whenever you run a Python program or an interactive session, the interpreter executes the code in the module or script that serves as an entry point to your program.

To investigate the names within your main global scope, you can use dir() , If you call it without arguments, then you’ll get the list of names that inside your current global scope while You can access or reference the value of any global name from any place in your code.

### Modifying global names 
is generally considered bad programming practice because it can lead to code that is:
Difficult to debug
Hard to understand
Impossible to reuse

### Good programming practice
recommends using local names rather than global names. Here are some tips:
Write self-contained functions that rely on local names rather than global ones.
Try to use unique objects names, no matter what scope you’re in.
Avoid global name modifications throughout your programs.
Avoid cross-module name modifications.
Use global names as constants that don’t change during your program’s execution.
Modifying the Behavior of a Python Scope


### Using the LEGB Rule for Python Scope
Functions: The Local Scope
The local scope or function scope is a Python scope created at function calls.

Nested Functions: The Enclosing Scope
Enclosing or nonlocal scope is observed when you nest functions inside other functions.

Modules: The Global Scope :
From the moment you start a Python program, you’re in the global Python scope. Internally, Python turns your program’s main script into a module called main to hold the main program’s execution. The namespace of this module is the main global scope of your program.

built-in:
scope is a special Python scope that’s created or loaded whenever you run a script or open an interactive session.
