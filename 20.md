## Django

Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites
With Django, you can take Web applications from concept to launch in a matter of hours. Django takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. Itâ€™s free and open source.

### The Structure of a Django Website:

A Django website consists of a single project that is split into separate apps. The idea is that each app handles a self-contained function that the site needs to perform. As an example, imagine an application like Instagram.

There are several different functions that need to be performed:
User management: Login, logout, register, and so on
The image feed: Uploading, editing, and displaying images
Private messaging: Private messages between users and notifications

### Django Model-View-Controller Pattern (MVC):

Model defines the data structure. This is usually a database and is the base layer to an application.
View displays some or all of the data to the user with HTML and CSS.
Controller handles how the database and the view interact.
