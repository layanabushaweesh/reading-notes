## Dynamic Routes

* Defining routes by using predefined paths is not always enough for complex applications.

* In Next.js you can add brackets to a page ([param]) to create a dynamic route (a.k.a. url slugs, pretty urls, and others).

* Page: pages/post/[pid].js:
```
import { useRouter } from 'next/router'
const Post = () => {
const router = useRouter()
const { pid } = router.query
return <p>Post: {pid}</p>
}

```
* Any route like /post/1, /post/abc, etc. will be matched by pages/post/[pid].js.

* The matched path parameter will be sent as a query parameter to the page, and it will be merged with the other query parameters.

## How to Statically Generate Pages with Dynamic Routes
In our case, we want to create dynamic routes for blog posts:

* We want each post to have the path /posts/, where is the name of the markdown file under the top-level posts directory.
* Since we have ssg-ssr.md and pre-rendering.md, weâ€™d like the paths to be /posts/ssg-ssr and /posts/pre-rendering.

## Deploying Your Next.js App

* The easiest way to deploy Next.js to production is to use the Vercel platform developed by the creators of Next.js. Vercel is an all-in-one platform with Global CDN supporting static & JAMstack deployment and Serverless Functions.
We believe Vercel is the optimal place to deploy Next.js apps.

>You can use default values for the following settings .
 Vercel automatically detects that you have a Next.js app and chooses optimal build settings for you:

* Project Name
* Root Directory
* Build Command
* Output Directory
* Development Command
